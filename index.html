                <h1>Who I am</h1>
            <p>My name is Robert Kemp and I am looking to become a software developer to help companies solve problems. My current experience includes over a year in graphic design and several months in customer service. I was also elected a student leader in my high school band for my senior year which has taught me skills necessary to help lead a group. I have also taken coding classes for a little over 2 years and have become knowledgeable in languages such as Python, C++, Javascript, C#, SQL, HTML, and CSS. I have helped with designing sportswear as well as my fair share of customer problems, some more complicated than others. I'm also described as a kind and hard worker who can listen and take criticism and feedback from others. I have also been often described as a quick learner.</p>
